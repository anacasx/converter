# JSON to CSV Converter

This repository contains a Java 17 project called **Converter**, developed to transform JSON files into CSV format.  
It includes:

- Java classes for reading JSON and writing CSV files.  
- Usage of **Jackson** for JSON parsing and **OpenCSV** for CSV generation.  
- Unit tests implemented with **JUnit 5**.  
- Sample input and output files located in the `sample_data` folder.  

The project demonstrates error handling, isolated testing, and JavaDoc documentation for clarity and maintainability.
